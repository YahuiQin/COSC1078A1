				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My name is Yahui Qin , my student number is 3730980, and the student email address is s3730980@student.rmit.edu.au. I am from China and I am 21 years old. I finished high school in China and then came to Australia. For the past two decades, I have always used Mandarin to communicate with people, but I have been learning English since I was a child and I also like foreign education methods, so I decided to study abroad. In my free time, I like to play games. My favorite game is League of Legends. This game is very competitive and the feeling of winning allows me to relax the most. I can communicate and cooperate with my teammates while playing the game, which is also what excites me.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Regarding IT, I have always found programming and production software extremely attractive, and I have also developed some interest in artificial intelligence and network security. From the beginning of junior high school, I found that computer knowledge attracted my attention. In my young age, work related to information technology is particularly cool, so I started to learn some simple programming knowledge. I still remember playing a game called ‘Lightbot’.This game allows users to learn simple programming logic while having the fun of the game, which is extremely aroused my interest in programming. We have classes and exchanges together, and we also participated in a robot competition together. In that competition, our team worked together to write simple codes for the robots to control movement and complete the actions required by the task. Through that experience, I completely fell in love with the IT major and knew that I would definitely choose to work in this industry in the future.</p>
				        <p>Before I applied to the university, my teachers and parents told me that RMIT is an excellent school, so I looked up many school-related information on the school's official website. The computer major of RMIT is relatively well-known throughout the world. RMIT has a large number of professional teachers, so the quality of teaching has a great guarantee. Most of the courses in school are taught in small classes, which can encourage students to actively participate in the classroom and better absorb knowledge. I think this kind of learning environment is quite suitable for me.In addition to high-quality course teaching, RMIT pays attention to students' graduation issues. The content of the courses are highly practical and creative, which can ensure that students have enough professional abilities when they graduate, so as to get a great job.</p>
					<p>I look forward to learn technology about programming,security and cloud computing, web computing, artificial intelligence, data management and software development.The world is gradually moving towards digitization, and these aspects are necessary for a computer major student.</p>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>This test made me clearly aware of what kind of personality I am in my life and work. For me, I am enthusiastic and responsible. I can feel the difficulties encountered by others in life and am willing to help. I like to complete tasks with others, and hope that I and my actions can be recognized and appreciated by others. This personality also has some shortcomings. I will be too selfless and sensitive, pay special attention about other people's problems and opinions, which will cause me to be distracted in my own affairs.In teamwork, I have excellent expression skills and a warm attitude towards others, which allows me to complete tasks well with other members. I have good organizational skills and do my best to complete tasks, so that I will be in the position of a leader.When forming a team, I should choose members who are adept at listening and thinking. When starting a task, I will have a clear idea of my own. At this time, I need other thoughtful teammates to judge my ideas.</p>

				<article>
					<h2>Test Two</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences</p>
					<p>According to this test, my learning style is biased towards practicality and observation. If I have a new idea, I will quickly try it first and gain experience. I am good at collecting and analyzing information, and extract what I want from this information. For me, abstract things are not suitable for me. I am more accustomed to taking quick actions and drawing conclusions from experiments.Meanwhile, I may be overconfident, which makes me not want to discuss with others, and only stick to my own ideas, even if that idea may be wrong. I will change my opinion only after I test it myself and get a conclusion, which will delay a lot of time.Based on the results of this test, I think that in the team I am a person who focuses on practical conclusions. When we are faced with a task, I will quickly put forward my own views and take action, not willing to spend time discussing whether this view is feasible. This will save time for our work, but what I need to make sure is that my point of view is not wrong. I may be reluctant to face other people's doubts about me.Therefore, when forming a team, I need to find other teammates who are willing to discuss with me and are patient. Pragmatism allows me to quickly point out the crux of the problem, but at the same time I also need to learn to listen to the opinions of others to avoid problems caused by overconfidence.</p>

					<h2>Test Three</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Big 5 Factors</p>
					<p>It can be seen from the test results that I am an extrovert, friendly and responsible person. I am proficient in the way of interacting with people, which makes it quite comfortable and relaxing when people get along with me. In the work, I will try my best to be the most appropriate within my abilities, and I am fully aware of my responsibilities.Although I am willing to communicate with others and help others solve problems, I also have some shortcomings, such as being too emotional. I am very susceptible to other people's emotions or language. This sensitive personality will make me pay special attention to other people's thoughts and affect my mood. In teamwork, I am familiar with thinking and have a lot of imaginative ideas. I may be able to communicate well with other team members and exchange ideas with each other, but it is also very likely that I will feel anxious because others deny my ideas. When forming a team, I can better get all members to work together, and there will be no members who cannot participate in the discussion because they are introverted and not good at expressing. This can make teamwork more smooth and successful.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My project idea is to create a completely smart home control system. This system can integrate all electrical appliances in the house through the Internet of Things technology, allowing users to control the home through speech and behavior.In my vision, the main operation mode of the system should be based on the user's behavior, by capturing the user's actions to achieve the user's purpose, and at the same time supplemented by voice control to replacing the original personal operation method and the latest mobile phone control system.The project uses advanced technologies such as network communication technology, automatic control technology, audio and video technology to integrate and control the facilities related to home life, build efficient residential facilities.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>The pace of society is accelerating, people are getting busy and the number of things to be handled at the same time is suddenly increasing. The participation of smart homes in life can greatly enhance people's happiness in life. In order to let people enjoy life better, engineers came up with multi-scene linkage, combining home appliances, security, and door control into a smart home. In addition, simplification of operation is the development trend that people expect. Adding image recognition to the smart home system can reduce the operations required by users. Users do not need to learn how to use control software. Only simple actions and languages can help them achieve the purpose of controlling the home and simplify the operation steps. This can bring users a safer, more efficient and comfortable smart life, leading the trend of modern smart homes.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The project consists of three parts: language recognition function, image recognition function and central processing unit. In order to achieve the purpose of controlling all households, a central microprocessor receives the information from the sensors, and then sends appropriate information to other electronic and electrical products in a predetermined procedure. First, a pair of glasses with simple functions will be designed to satisfy the image recognition function. This pair of glasses contains cameras, sensors, and storage and transmission equipment. When the user uses the glasses for the first time, the system requires the user to use the camera on the lens to take pictures of all the homes. After the camera enters the picture data of the furniture, it will be stored in the storage transmission module and uploaded to the central control system. For example, when the user chooses "enter curtain information", the user puts on the glasses and stands in front of the curtain to take photos from various angles. The final data will be transmitted to the central processing unit. When the user needs to open the curtain, the control system allows the user to sit on the sofa and look at the curtain with glasses. The glasses successfully capture the curtain information and send data to the central processing unit. After the recognition is successful, the user speaks a simple password ‘open’ to open the curtain. This function can effectively reduce the user's operation and create a fast and convenient life. On the other hand, the voice recognition system is a function to assist in image recognition. When the user speaks the command ‘on’ or ‘off’ to the speaker, the vocabulary content in the voice is converted into computer-readable input and data is sent to the central microprocessor. After the glasses first send a successful identification message to the system, the smart speaker can collect the next instructions from the user. In addition, smart speakers can also collect user commands such as "open curtains" separately. This operation allows users to have alternative solutions to open it when they are not looking at the furniture.The user can turn on the air conditioner in the living room in the room, but this means that the user needs to speak longer instructions.The central control system is composed of remote control equipment, central control host and various control ports. The host will be connected to a screen inlaid on the wall to intuitively show the various modules of the furniture to the user. When the control system receives the information from the sensor, it analyzes and processes the information, and then completes the instructions through the control program.When the instruction is completed, the icon of that household module on the screen will change to remind the user that the operation is successful. At the same time, the screen also allows the user to control each module by touch. After clicking into a furniture module, the user can choose ‘on’ or ‘off’ to control the furniture.</p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The hardware required for this project includes micro cameras, infrared sensors, smart switches, smart speakers, smart glasses, lighting equipment, smart door locks, electric curtains, bathroom toilets, kitchen appliances and terminal controllers. The required software is central control software. The existing open source smart homes have ‘homeassistant’.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The required skills are electronic technology, communication technology, graphic design technology, radio technology, image recognition technology and integrated wiring technology.In order to realize this project, the hardware knowledge that needs to be learned is circuit board chip-level development. The software needs to learn the underlying language and know how to program the control software with java. In the next three years of study, I will learn most of the software knowledge and master most of the technologies. The knowledge of hardware requires elective courses or learning in the process of work after graduation.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project is successful, Through this intelligent system, the user can achieve the purpose of controlling the furniture through the simplest and fastest operation. This can effectively reduce users' unnecessary operations in normal life, such as walking to the door to turn on the lights.The realization of smart homes has changed the one-to-one mechanical switch mode of traditional homes, and raised family life to a kind of system management. Its control methods are not only diversified and more humanized, but also allow people to obtain a higher sense of happiness. This project will eventually lead to the popularization of smart homes in every family and increase the convenience that high technology brings to people.</p>
